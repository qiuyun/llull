Thesis: Design and implementation of efficient system scheduling policies for 
big data workloads regarding of current hardware challenges, 
e.g. heterogeneous processors, non-uniform memory systems and application
interference.

M.S. in Embedded Systems and Information Processing, University Paris Sud,
(Paris XI), France, 2009-2012, Rank: 3/43
Magistere in Information Systems and Technology, University Paris Sud,
France, 2009-2012

B.S. in Optoelectronic Information Engineering, Huazhong University of 
Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, GPA: 87/100

RESEARCH EXPERIENCE 
==============================================================================
Application Colocation Framework on Shared Hardware with Cooperative Games,
Duke University, 01/2015-11/2015 
Designed an end-to-end interference-aware task collocation framework for 
datacenters. Profiled Spark big data analytics on Intel server platforms to 
characterize application resource contention. Adopted a recommendation 
system to predict colocation preferences. Implemented and evaluated task 
scheduling mechanisms with the solution to a cooperative game.

Coordinating NUMA Policies and Queueing Dynamics in Blade Servers,
Duke University, 06/2013-06/2014 
Performed power modeling for DRAM and inter-processor communication 
technologies. Implemented delay-scheduling in a queueing simulator to model 
online task schedulers for large-scale server systems. Built a model to 
coordinate hardware configurations (inter-processor communication 
technologies) and management software design (schedulers). 

Datacenter Workloads Characterization and Simulation Methodologies,
Duke University, 08/2013-06/2014 
Prepared a web search engine for English Wikipedia with Apache Solr 
interface. Deployed graph analytical framework to process big datasets. 
Explored task schedulers and data placement strategies. Built work-flow
from detailed cycle-accurate simulator to high-level event-driven
simulator to model workloads' sensitivity to hardware architecture.




WORK EXPERIENCE 
==============================================================================
Oracle Corporation, Intern, Belmont, CA, US, 06/2014-11/2014
Worked on performance analysis for RAPID project, a hardware-software 
co-design system targeting large-scale data management and analysis.

Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Research Intern, 
Launsanne, Switzerland, 03/2012-08/2012
Worked on system performance analysis in the HiperCore group. Debugged and 
profiled the performance of a Freescale P5020 development system (Power 
Architecture) for high-performance computing benchmarks.

Laboratory of Signal and Systems (LSS), Supélec, CNRS, Research Intern, 
France, 06/2011-10/2011 
Implemented maximum a-posterior estimator via belief propagation in MATLAB. 
Reconstructed overcomplete input signals performed by oversampled filter 
banks from noisy quantized transmission channels.

Ecole Normale Supérieur Cachan (ENS) Cachan, Research Intern, France,
03/2011-05/2011
Developed the software hardware interface for a robot, designed for autistic
infants. Cross-compiled a Linux kernel for an embedded processor (OMAP).
Developed display and network interfaces.
